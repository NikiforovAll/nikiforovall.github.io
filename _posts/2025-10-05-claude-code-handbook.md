Previously, I've shared my [Claude Code Usage Best Practices and Recommendations](https://nikiforovall.blog/productivity/2025/06/13/claude-code-rules).

Since than, I've been using Claude Code extensively and have refined my practices further. In this post, I present an updated handbook of best practices and recommendations for using Claude Code for daily use.
