## TL;DR

LazyClaude is a keyboard-driven TUI for managing Claude Code customizations (slash commands, subagents, skills, MCPs, hooks). Version 0.12.0 introduces a built-in marketplace browser that lets you discover, preview, and install plugins without leaving the terminal. If you're new to LazyClaude, check out the [original announcement](/ai/2025/12/07/lazyclaude) for a full introduction.

## Why LazyClaude?

Managing Claude Code customizations means navigating multiple configuration directories (`~/.claude/`, `./.claude/`, `~/.claude/plugins/`) and understanding what's defined at each level. LazyClaude gives you a visual, keyboard-driven interface that shows everything in one place.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Visual Exploration**: See all customizations organized by type (slash commands, subagents, skills, memory files, MCPs, hooks)
- **Multi-Level Management**: Understand and manage configurations across user, project, and plugin levels
- **Keyboard-Driven Workflow**: Navigate with vim-style keys (`j`/`k`), no mouse required
- **Copy/Move Between Levels**: Easily share personal configs with your team or customize plugin content
- **Integrated Marketplace**: Discover and install plugins without leaving the terminal (new in 0.12.0!)

## Getting Started

Launch with `uvx lazyclaude` and you'll see a multi-panel interface inspired by lazygit:

<center>
  <video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58d74db8-cb5e-4a56-881f-9f3c4ace011d" controls="controls" style="margin: 15px;" width="100%"/>
</center>

**Interface Overview:**
- **Left Sidebar**: Panels for each customization type (`[1]` Slash Commands, `[2]` Subagents, `[3]` Skills, `[4]` Memory, `[5]` MCPs, `[6]` Hooks)
- **Right Pane**: Content and metadata view for the selected item
- **Status Bar**: Shows current path and active filter
- **Footer**: Keyboard shortcuts reference

**Quick Navigation:**
- `1-6` or `Tab` - Switch between panels
- `j`/`k` or arrow keys - Navigate items
- `[` / `]` - Toggle between content and metadata views
- `?` - Show help, `q` - Quit

## Core Workflows

### Filtering and Viewing Configurations

LazyClaude helps you understand where customizations are defined. Use filters to narrow your view:

- `a` - Show All levels
- `u` - Show only User level (`~/.claude/`)
- `p` - Show only Project level (`./.claude/`)
- `P` - Show only Plugin level (`~/.claude/plugins/`)
- `D` - Toggle visibility of disabled plugins

</center>

This makes it easy to:
- See what's personal vs. shared with your team
- Understand what comes from installed plugins
- Find where a specific customization is defined

### Editing and Managing Configurations

- `e` - Open in your `$EDITOR`
- `c` - Copy to another level (e.g., copy plugin config to user level to customize)
- `m` - Move to another level
- `C` - Copy file path to clipboard

**Common Patterns:**

**Customize a Plugin:**
```
[P]lugin → navigate → [c]opy → User → [e]dit
```

**Share with Team:**
```
[u]ser → navigate → [c]opy → Project → git commit
```

## What's New in 0.12.0: Marketplace Browser

Version 0.12.0 adds integrated marketplace support. Press `M` to open the marketplace browser:

### Browse and Install Plugins

Navigate available plugins with vim-style keys (`j`/`k`), expand marketplace trees with `l`, and install plugins with `i`.

  <video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44ff0440-ad0c-46be-9ce6-38aefe12143d" controls="controls" style="margin: 15px;" width="100%"/>
</center>

**Marketplace Actions:**
- `i` - Install plugin (or enable if disabled)
- `d` - Uninstall plugin
- `e` - Open plugin folder in file manager
- `/` - Search within marketplace

### Preview Before Installing

Press `p` on any plugin to enter preview mode. The marketplace closes and the main interface shows you all the plugin's contents (slash commands, skills, etc.) in read-only mode. Explore what you're getting before you install it.

</center>

**Preview Mode Benefits:**
- View all customizations included in a plugin
- Read content and metadata without installing
- Understand plugin structure and capabilities
- Navigate as if the plugin were installed (read-only)

Press `Esc` to exit preview mode and return to the normal view.
